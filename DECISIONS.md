# DECISIONS.md

Decision log for agent work on SCORA. Product decisions from April 2026 live in `01_SCORA_90-Day_Execution_Plan_v1_4.md` §8. Newest first.

### 2026-10-12: Port of remaining voice patterns waits for Node on the Studio
- Status: NEEDS EVAN
- Branch: none yet
- Context: the night worker on Mac-Studio has no Node or npm, so it cannot run the @scora/voice tests; it took the ChatView emoji item instead.
- Options: install Node on the Studio (Homebrew `node@20`), or leave voice work to the MacBook.
- Why: nothing ships untested. Also, doc 06 holds only 12 v0.3 entries (7 ported); the 40 v0.1 and 5 v0.2 entries needed to reach 20+ are not in the repo.
- To reverse: n/a.

### 2026-10-11: Agents push branches, Evan merges to main
- Status: DECIDED (by Evan)
- Branch: claude/push-policy
- Context: OpenClaw's AGENTS.md lets it commit and push on its own; Claude Code was not pushing at all.
- Choice: every agent pushes its own branch to origin when ready for review. Only Evan pushes to or merges into main, on GitHub. No force-pushes.
- Why: Evan reviews everything before it lands; two agents pushing to main would collide.
- To reverse: edit CLAUDE.md §9.1.

### 2026-10-11: OpenClaw workspace files in the repo
- Status: NEEDS EVAN (Evan is handling OpenClaw)
- Branch: none
- Context: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md sit in the repo root and are on GitHub.
- Options: keep them, or make `~/scora` the OpenClaw workspace with the repo at `~/scora/app`.
- Why: USER.md holds personal context; OpenClaw's AGENTS.md also still says to push on its own.
- To reverse: n/a until decided.

### 2026-10-11: Shared agent workflow lives in the repo
- Status: DECIDED
- Branch: claude/agent-workflow-docs
- Context: Claude Code and OpenClaw both work on this repo and kept separate memory.
- Choice: CLAUDE.md §9.1 holds the workflow rules; PLAN.md, DECISIONS.md, MEMORY.md and memory/ are the shared state both agents read and write. Private per-tool memory is not a source of truth.
- Why: git is the only thing both agents and both machines share.
- To reverse: delete §9.1, PLAN.md and DECISIONS.md.
