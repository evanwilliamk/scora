# DECISIONS.md

Decision log for agent work on SCORA. Product decisions from April 2026 live in `01_SCORA_90-Day_Execution_Plan_v1_4.md` §8. Newest first.

### 2026-10-11: Posture rules ported from doc 07 v1
- Status: DECIDED (review when you can)
- Branch: claude/posture-engine
- Context: no posture engine existed (the LLM picked posture), and doc 07 v2 dropped the rules.
- Choice: ported doc 07 v1 §8.3 thresholds as written into packages/posture. Missing drivers make a clause false, so no data reads steady.
- Open questions: (1) taper fires only while load_7d is still above 0.8x weekly chronic, which reads backwards for a taper; (2) PRD v1 says taper window is 14 days, doc 07 says 7.
- Why: the v1 doc is the only written spec.
- To reverse: edit packages/posture/src/constants.ts and bump POSTURE_ENGINE_VERSION.

### 2026-10-11: Agents push branches, Evan merges to main
- Status: DECIDED (by Evan)
- Branch: claude/push-policy
- Context: OpenClaw's AGENTS.md lets it commit and push on its own; Claude Code was not pushing at all.
- Choice: every agent pushes its own branch to origin when ready for review. Only Evan pushes to or merges into main, on GitHub. No force-pushes.
- Why: Evan reviews everything before it lands; two agents pushing to main would collide.
- To reverse: edit CLAUDE.md §9.1.

### 2026-10-11: OpenClaw workspace files in the repo
- Status: NEEDS EVAN (Evan is handling OpenClaw)
- Branch: none
- Context: AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, HEARTBEAT.md sit in the repo root and are on GitHub.
- Options: keep them, or make `~/scora` the OpenClaw workspace with the repo at `~/scora/app`.
- Why: USER.md holds personal context; OpenClaw's AGENTS.md also still says to push on its own.
- To reverse: n/a until decided.

### 2026-10-11: Shared agent workflow lives in the repo
- Status: DECIDED
- Branch: claude/agent-workflow-docs
- Context: Claude Code and OpenClaw both work on this repo and kept separate memory.
- Choice: CLAUDE.md §9.1 holds the workflow rules; PLAN.md, DECISIONS.md, MEMORY.md and memory/ are the shared state both agents read and write. Private per-tool memory is not a source of truth.
- Why: git is the only thing both agents and both machines share.
- To reverse: delete §9.1, PLAN.md and DECISIONS.md.
